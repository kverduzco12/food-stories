Generation to generation
This story comes from me, Karen Verduzco, who grew up in Texas, where the process and production of tamales has always been meaningful and carried by tradition.

Love in our hands

Rememberance within my own hands
The yearly ritual of making tamales shaped my understanding of food, identity and even family. Bonding with the women in my family while making a meal that means so much to us has created a gateway of knowlege into my ancestors and myself. Tamales predate colonization and have eveolved over hundreads of years but the process of making them has always remainded just as sacred and meaningful. In between it all I find a middle ground between my Mexican American Identity.





 Identity, belonging, and culture

Tamales hold deep importance and cultural significance in Mexican communities. In my family, tamales bond us together and move from food to feeling. From the process of the ingredients being chosen all the way to the consumption of them. Every Thanksgiving and Christmas eve, all the women in my family gather together and prepare the tamales together. Although tamales are a central dish, the narrative focuses more on the relationships and bonding. For my family and I, tamales mark moments of bonding, tradition, and connection that reinforces my personal cultural identity. This circles back to themes we have discussed in class that certain foods are not just about eating.

The process of making tamales is communal compared to other dishes that are made quickly and do not require much help. Tamales require a group effort and a lot of time dedicated. Each corn husk must be individually soaked and washed carefully, the meat needs to be prepared hours before to make sure its tender and all of the flavor hits just right, the masa must be made in a large amount and it must be made in the right consistency, finally each tamale is put together by hand and crafted with care and love. These tasks are shared within each of us as we share conversation, joke, give advice, revisit memories, etc. The kitchen becomes a sacred space. In contrast to American food culture which prioritizes convenience and speed.

This story emphasises how women are seen as caretakers and collectors of knowledge that is passed down from generation to generation in Mexican culture. Recipes are usually taught one on one instead of written down. There is a lot of feeling and viewing that is used in Mexican recipes compared to American recipes. With tamales the masa has to feel a certain way, the meat has to lay a certain way, and the corn husk has to be folded a certain way. Mexican culture associates cooking with care and family responsibility and gives women authority and respect in the family structure. I have seen the respect my mother has gained in my family because of the knowledge she carries. Unlike many family households in America, my mother is the head of the household instead of my father.

Tamales have existed before European colonization and to me represent a symbol of continuity against anything that threatens our culture and identity. There are various ways and types of tamales that can be made, representing how Mexican culture adapts to change while still persevering the tradition, meaning, and memory.

Authenticity does not exactly mean that tamales follow one exact recipe because every family makes them differently depending on tradition or even region. Authenticity is measured through tradition, intention, and bonding. In American culture tamales are often seen as “authentic” but the labor and cultural meaning behind the process are often dismissed. My mom and Dad’s side both make tamales differently but the process of reunion, love, and care all stay the same.

The making of tamales allows me to preserve my cultural identity even though I do not live in Mexico and things are different in America. It is easy to feel disconnected from that side of myself because I live away from my family and am fully immersed in American culture which prioritizes convenience but every Thanksgiving and Christmas I am reminded of who I am. Through a shared ritual of something that may seem so simple from the outside, my family shows resistance against the change as my ancestors have done for hundreds of years. Tamales are not just a food, they are an assertion of my personal identity.
