Food Stories is a collaborative digital archive dedicated to preserving the lived experiences, memories, and meanings of food in American life. While recipes and ingredients can be written down, the stories that surround food — how it’s made, shared, remembered, and reimagined — are often fleeting, passed through conversation, gesture, and routine. This project seeks to capture those moments before they disappear.

By gathering oral histories from diverse participants, Food Stories explores how food functions as a site of cultural memory, belonging, and transformation. Community-driven archives like this one challenge traditional models of collecting and preserving the past: they value personal narrative alongside material evidence, and they affirm that everyday experience is itself a form of historical knowledge.

In documenting these stories together, we recognize the archive not as a static repository, but as a living record shaped by participation, care, and shared authorship — a way of understanding history through the tastes, textures, and memories that define community life.
