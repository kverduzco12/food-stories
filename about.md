# About Food Stories
*Food Stories* is a collaborative digital archive built with **static site technology** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. Each student participant creates and manages a personal repository, contributing oral histories, images, and metadata through **version-controlled workflows**. Contributions are reviewed and merged into the main site through **pull requests**, allowing the class to collaborate openly while maintaining a transparent record of authorship, revision, and participation.

This technical framework is intentionally designed for **sustainability and reuse**. Because the project relies on open, lightweight, and well-documented tools, it can be easily **continued by future classes or adapted by other courses and institutions**. Each new cohort of students can build upon the existing archive, expanding its scope and deepening its historical and cultural record over time — creating a model of **durable, evolving digital scholarship**.

In addition to learning the mechanics of web collaboration, students conduct and record **oral histories about food and community**, then apply **basic audio editing skills** in *Audacity* to refine their recordings for clarity and presentation. These digital skills complement the interpretive and archival aspects of the course, reinforcing how technology can support the ethical and creative dimensions of public history work.

Pedagogically, this workflow transforms infrastructure into inquiry: students learn not only about the history of American food, but also about **how historical knowledge is produced, curated, and preserved** in digital environments. Through collaborative authorship on GitHub, they engage in the principles of **documentation, transparency, and shared stewardship** that underpin both archival practice and digital humanities.

Ultimately, *Food Stories* demonstrates that digital scholarship can be **both sustainable and participatory**—combining technical literacy, community engagement, and historical care to create an open, living archive of food and memory.
