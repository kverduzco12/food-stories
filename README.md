# Food Stories
_Food Stories_ is a collaborative digital project created by students in the History of American Food course. This site collects and shares oral histories that explore how food shapes memory, identity, and community across the United States. Each story offers a personal window into the histories behind recipes, traditions, and everyday meals — revealing how what we eat connects us to the past and to one another.

Built as a student-led archive, _Food Stories_ celebrates the voices and experiences that make up America’s diverse culinary landscape.
